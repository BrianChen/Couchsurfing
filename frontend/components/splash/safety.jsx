        <h2>Have A Backup Plan</h2>
        <p>Know your options. If something doesn’t work out with your host, or if they misrepresented themselves or their home, make sure you have an alternate place to stay. Identify the nearest hostel or hotel, or have a backup host in place before you go. If possible, research your host’s neighborhood prior to arriving, including how to get to and from there on your own. If you’re heading to an event or joining a Hangout, look up the location prior to attending.</p>
        <h2>Know Your Limits</h2>
        <p>Partying like a rockstar might be fun, but it puts your safety and well-being in the hands of others.</p>
        <h2>Report Negative Experiences</h2>
        <p>Our Trust and Safety team is here to help build the safest and most trusted community possible. Reporting safety concerns to Couchsurfing helps keep future Floorsurfers safe. </p>
